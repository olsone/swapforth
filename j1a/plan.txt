I2S sound project
aside: use logic analyzer to decode SPI.


1. drive the HDR2 peripheral from forth [DONE i2s.fs]
2. drive the HDR2 peripheral with clock in HDL
3. build LRCLK and MCLK in HDL
4. add symbol register in HDL and send to I2S. manipulate from forth.
5. add toggle register in HDL
6. add timing register in HDL and connect register to forth
7. build wave function in HDL

1. 
Alternatives
1a. remove the ioport hdr1 declaration from j1a.v, replace it with custom HDL
1b. try bit banging the hdr1
3b. bit bang LRCK and MCLK

Requirements

Implement powerup behavior - MCK, LRCK and SCLK for 256 clocks (1 LRCK cycle). Do this with RESET.

	"Once MCLK and LRCK are detected, MCLK occurrences are counted over one LRCK period to determine the MCLK/LRCK frequency ratio. Power is then applied to the internal voltage reference."
	
	"Once valid LRCK and SDIN are supplied (and SCLK if used) approximately 2000 sample periods later audio output begins"

direction bits 1:output, 0:input
we want 4 outputs

Frequencies
	
	MCK
	With bit-banging i2s.fs achieved 645 kHz.
	\ measurement of MCK: 1.55 us/cycle or 645kHz (spec .5 to 50 MHz)
	
	LRCK
	\ input sample rate is 1/32 of that or 24kHz (spec 2 to 200 kHz)
	
	SCLK internal only if certain ratios
	Prefer SCLK external equal to MCK.
	
	IceStick clock 12 MHz
	LRCLK = CLK/256 = 46875
	
	Square wave
	anything up to SCLK

Ideally
	HDL runs MCK and SCLK at 12 MHz.
	LRCK is 1/256
